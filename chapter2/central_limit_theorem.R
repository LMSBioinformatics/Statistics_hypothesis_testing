# i) Small sample size .......................................................

# Sample size and number of repetitions
n = 5
reps <- 1000

# Initialize the vector of sample means and std sample means
sample_mean <- rep(0, reps)
std_sample_mean <- rep(0, reps)

# Loop over repetitions
for (i in 1:reps) {
      x <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)

}

# Histogram of mean values

     freq = FALSE,
     breaks = 40,
     xlim = c(-3, 3),
     ylim = c(0, 0.8),
     xlab = paste("n =", n),
     main = "")

# Overlay normal distribution N(0,1)
curve(dnorm(x),
      lwd = 2,
      col = "darkred",
      add = TRUE)

# ii) Large sample size .......................................................

# Sample size and number of repetitions

# Initialize the vector of sample means and std sample means

# Overlay normal distribution N(0,1)

      lwd = 2,
      col = "darkred",
      add = TRUE)

# iii) Iterate over sample sized ..............................................

# Set sample sizes

# Subdivide plot panel
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

# Iterate over sample sizes

      }
